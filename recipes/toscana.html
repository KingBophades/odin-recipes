        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound bulk mild Italian sausage</li>
            <li>1 1/4 teaspoons red pepper flakes </li>
            <li>4 slices bacon, cut into 1/2 inch pieces</li>
            <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
            <li>8 3/4 cups chicken broth</li>
            <li>6 potatoes, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>6 cups chopped fresh kale</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>

        <ol>
            <li>Cook and stir Italian sausage and red pepper flakes in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat until sausage is browned and crumbly, 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer sausage mixture to a bowl.</li>
            <li>Stir bacon into the same Dutch oven and cook over medium heat until bacon is crisp, about 10 minutes. Drain fat, leaving a few tablespoons of drippings in the Dutch oven.</li>

            <li>Pour chicken broth into bacon mixture; bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Stir potatoes and kale into broth; cook until potatoes are tender and soup is flavorful, about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir sausage and heavy whipping cream into soup, reduce heat to medium, and cook until soup is heated through, about 5 minutes more.</li>
        </ol>
